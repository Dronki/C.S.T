# C.S.T
This "framework" was written back in 2011 and later updated 2012 with a ticket and booking-system.

## History ##
Back in 2011, I started learning PHP, and I wrote a system for sharing and editing notes, and I was asked to make a website for a club in my school.  
2012, a ticket and booking-system was added.  

This being said, I do not recommend that you use this code as a base for a project, I suggest that you instead take a look at an MVC like Laravell or CodeIgniter. So Sit back, grab a cup of coffee, and look through some horrible code and please laugh.

## Notes ##
Along the way, I lost the database-backup, so that file is missing. But that's kind of good, since I stored passwords in plain text back then and the system had around 40-50 active users at ticket-release.

## License ##
Do whatever you like with this code.
